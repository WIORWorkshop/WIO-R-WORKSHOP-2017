# 1. Using R as a calculator
### 1.1. Doing arithmetic with R
#The simplest thing you could do with R is to arithmetic
1+100

#Here, we've added 1 and and 100 together to make 101. The [1] preceeding 
#this we will explain in a minute. 
#For now, think of it as something that indicates output.
#of operations is same as in maths class (from highest to lowest precedence)

#+ Brackets
#+ Exponents
#+ Divide
#+ Multiply
#+ Add
#+ Subtract

#What will this evaluate to?

3+5*2

#The "caret" symbol (or "hat") is the exponent (to-the-power-of) operator 
#(read `x ^ y` as "x to the power of y"). What will this evaluate to?

3+5*2^2

#Use brackets (actually parentheses) to group to force the order of evaluation if it differs from the default, or to set your own order.

(3+5)*2

##But this can get unweidly when not needed:

(3+(5*(2^2))) # hard to read

3+5*2^2 #easier to read, once you know some rules

3+5*(2^2) # if you forget some rules, this might help

#See ?Arithmetic for more information, and two more operators (you can also
#get there by `?"+"` (note the quotes)

?Arithmetic

##If R thinks that the statement is incomplete, it will change the prompt 
#from `>` to `+` indicating that it is expecting more input. 
#This is not an addition sign! 
#Try: 

3+5*(2^2

#Press `"Esc"` if you want to cancel this statement and return to the prompt.

### 1.2. Comparing objects with R
#The usual sort of comparison operators are available:

1 == 1 #equality (note two equals signs, read as "is equal to")

1 == 2

1 != 2 #inequality (read as "is not equal to")

1<2 # less than

1<=1 # less than or equal to"


1>0 # greater than


1>= -9 # greater than or equal to

#See `?Comparison` for more information (you can also get there by `help("==")`.

### 1.3. Scientific notation with R
##Really small numbers get a scientific notation:


2/10000

#which you can write in too:

2e-04

#Read `e-XX` as "multiplied by `10^XX"`, so `2e-4` is `2 * 10^(-4)`.

### 1.4. Mathematical functions with R

#R has many built in mathematical functions that will work as you would expect:

sin(1) # trigonometric functions

asin(1) # inverse sin (also for cos and tan)"

log(1) #natural logarithm

log10(100) # base-10 logarithm  

log2(100) # base-2 logarithm  

exp(0.5) #e^(1/2)


#Plus things like probability density functions for many common distributions, 
#and other mathematical functions (e.g., Gamma, Beta, Bessel). 
#If you need it, it's probably there

#2. Data objects in R

### 2.1. Variables and assignment
#You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

x <-1/40

#and now the variable `x` contains the **value** `0.025`

x

#(note that it does not contain the fraction 1/40, it contains a decimal 
#approximation of this fraction. This appears exact in this case, but it is not.
#These decimal approximations are called "floating point numbers" 
#and at some point you will probably end up having to learn more about them than
#you'd like).
#Look up at the top right pane of RStudio, and you'll see that this has appeared 
#in the "Workspace" pane.

#Our variable `x` can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects 
#a number.

log(x)

sin(x)

#The right hand side of the assignment can be any valid R expression.

#It is also possible to use the `=` operator for assignment:

x=1/40

#but this is much less common among R users. The most important thing is to 
#be **consistent** with the operator you use. 
#There are occasionally places where it is less confusing to use 
#`<-` than `=`, and it is the most common symbol used in the community. 
#So I'd recommend `<-`.

#Notice that assignment does not print a value.

x<-100

#Notice also that variables can be reassigned.
#`x`used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100).

x

#Assignment values can contain the variable being assigned to: What will `x`
#contain after running this?

x<-x+1
x

# Clean up
rm(x)  # Remove an object from workspace

# Remove more than one
a<-5
b<-10
rm(a, b)  

# Clear entire workspace
rm(list = ls()) 


###2.2. Vectors

#R was designed for people who do data analysis. There is a reason why "data" 
#is a more common term than "datum" - generally you have more than one piece of
#data (although the Guardian argues that this distinction is old fashioned). 
#As a result in R all data types are actually vectors. 
#So the number '1' is actually a vector of numbers that happens to be of length 1.

1

length(1) # length(): get the length of a vector

### Build a specific vector
#To build a vector, use the c(). function (`c` stands for "concatenate")
x<- c(1,2,40,1234)
x

length(x)

#(notice how RStudio has updated its description of x. 
#If you click it, you'll get an option to alter it, 
#which is rarely what you want to do).
#This is a deep piece of engineering in the design; most of R thinks quite 
#happily in terms of vectors. If you wanted to double all the values in the vector,
#just multiply it by 2:

2*x

#You can get the maximum value:

max(x)

#... the minimum value 

min(x)

##... the sum

sum(x)

#... the mean value

mean(x)

#and so on. There are huge numbers of functions that operate on vectors. It is more common that functions will than that they won't.

#Vectors can be summed together:

y<- c(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4)
x+y

#and they can be concatenate together:

c(x,y)

#... and scalars can be added to them

x+0.1

#**Be careful** though: if you add/multiply together vectors that are of
#different lengths, but the lengths factor, R will silently "recycle" the length 
#of the shorter one:

x

x*c(-2,2)

##The **first** and **third** element have been multiplied by **-2** while the **second** and **fourth** element are multiplied by *2*.

#If the length of the shorter vector is not a factor of the length of the longer vector, you will get a warning, but **the calculation will happen anyway**:

x*c(-2,0,2)

##This is almost never what you want. Pay attention to warnings. 
#Note that Warnings are different to Errors. We just saw a warning, 
#where what happened is (probably) undesirable but not fatal. 
#You'll get Errors where what happened has been deemed unrecoverable. 
#For example:

x+z

#Just as with the scalars, we can do comparisons. 
#This returns a new vector of TRUE and FALSE indicating which elements are less than 10:

x<10

#You can do a vector-vector comparison too:

x<y

#And combined arithmetic operations with comparison operations. Both sides of the expression are fully evaluated before the comparison takes place:

x>1/y

#Be careful with comparisons: This compares the first element with -20, 
#the second with 20, the third with -20 and the fourth with 20.

x>=c(-20,20)

#This does nothing sensible, really, and warns you again:

x == c(-2,0,2)

#All the comparison operators work in fairly predictible ways:

x == 40

x != 2

#### Define a vector with a sequence

#Sequences are easy to make, and often useful. Integer sequences can be made 
#with the colon operator:

3:10 # sequence 3,4,5,...,10

#Which also works backwards:

10:3

#Step in different sizes with `seq()`

seq(3,10,by=2)

seq(3,10,length=10)

#Now we will see the meaning of the [1] term - this indicates that you're 
#looking at the first element of a vector. If you make a really long vector, 
#you'll see new numbers:

seq(3,by=2,length=100)

#### Finding specific elements in a vector

#First, assign an element to x

x=seq(3,by=2,length=100) # x is assigned a vector of length 100, starting from 3, 
#with an increment of 2
x

#Find the 1st element of x using `[]`

x[1] # 1st element

x[2] # 2nd element

x[100] # 100th element

###2.3. Matrix

#Define a matrix (assign to y) with 9 rows and 3 columns using the data in x
#**Note**: x has been used several time previously. If you wish to assign a new 
#value to x, clean x first by removing it from the workspace.

x  
rm(x)
x # if an error meesage "object x not found", x has been removed succesfully

x=1:27
y <- matrix(data=x,nrow=9,ncol=3)
y


#Dimension of y with `dim()`
dim(y)

#Result provides a vector of 2. The first element is the number of lines (here 9) 
#and the second element is the number of columns (here 3 columns).

#Extract a value from y with []

y[1,2] # The element at the crossroad between the line 1 and column 2

Extract a line from y with []

y[1,] # line 1

Extract a column from y with `[]`

y[,1] # column 1

#### Extract a vector from y using the numerical indices in x

y[x]  # referencing an object with another object

#### Define a 3-dimensional array (assign to z) with 3 rows, 
#3 columns and 3 layers, using the data in x


z <- array(data=x,dim=c(3,3,3))#Arrays are the R data objects which can store 
#data in more than two dimensions.

z
z[x]
z[rev(x)] # What does the function rev() do? How can you find out?

#### Browse the datasets available in R, find Edgar Anderson's Iris data and load 
#it as a dataframe 

data(iris)
head(iris)
dim(iris)
#view(iris)

#### Convert the iris dataset to a matrix and check the data types

iris2 <- as.matrix(iris)
head(iris2)
mode(iris2)

iris3 <- as.matrix(iris[,1:4])
head(iris3)
mode(iris3)

#### Using matrices instead of data frames 

#When data is all numbers (except for row and column names), 
#I normally use matrices rather than dataframes
#If you have row names in your data file, and you want to convert to a matrix, 
#you will need to specify which column has the row names 
#(see the row.names argument in the read.table function)
