**Questions**

  + What are the different methods for accessing parts of a data frame?

**Objectives**

  + Understand the three different ways R can address data inside a data frame.
  + Combine different methods for addressing data with the assignment operator to update subsets of data.

R is a powerful language for data manipulation. There are three main ways for addressing data inside R objects.

  + By index (slicing)
  + By logical vector
  + By name (columns only)
  
Lets start by loading some sample data:

```{r }
dat <- read.csv(file = 'data/sample.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

The first row of this csv file is a list of column names. We used the *header=TRUE* argument to `read.csv` so that R can interpret the file correctly. We are using the *stringsAsFactors=FALSE* argument to override the default behaviour for R. Using factors in R is covered in a separate lesson.

Lets take a look at this data.

```{r }
class(dat)
```

R has loaded the contents of the .csv file into a variable called `dat` which is a `data frame`.

```{r}
dim(dat)
```

The data has 100 rows and 9 columns.

```{r}
head(dat)
```

The data is the results of an (not real) experiment, looking at the number of aneurysms that formed in the eyes of patients who undertook 3 different treatments.

## Addressing by Index

Data can be accessed by index. We have already seen how square brackets [ can be used to subset (slice) data. The generic format is `dat[row_numbers,column_numbers]`.

### Selecting Values

What will be returned by `dat[1,1]`?

```{r}
dat[1,1]
```

If we leave out a dimension R will interpret this as a request for all values in that dimension.

### Selecting More Values

What will be returned by `dat[,2]`?
The colon `:` can be used to create a sequence of integers.

```{r}
6:9
```

Creates a vector of numbers from 6 to 9.

This can be very useful for addressing data.

### Subsetting with Sequences

Use the colon operator to index just the aneurism count data (columns 6 to 9).

Finally we can use the `c()` (combine) function to address non-sequential rows and columns.

```{r}
dat[c(1,5,7,9), 1:5]
```

Returns the first 5 columns for patients in rows 1,5,7 & 9

### Subsetting Non-Sequential Data

Return the age and gender values for the first 5 patients.

## Addressing by Name
Columns in an R data frame are named.

```{r}
names(dat)
```

### Default Names

If names are not specified e.g. using `headers=FALSE` in a `read.csv()` function, R assigns default names `V1,V2,...,Vn`
We usually use the `$` operator to address a column by name

```{r}
dat$Gender
```

Named addressing can also be used in square brackets.

```{r}
head(dat[,c('Age', 'Gender')])
```

### Best Practice

Best practice is to address columns by name, often you will create or delete columns and the column position will change.

## Logical Indexing

A logical vector contains only the special values `TRUE & FALSE`.

```{r}
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

### Truth and Its Opposite

Note the values `TRUE` and `FALSE` are all capital letters and are not quoted.
Logical vectors can be created using `relational operators` e.g. `<, >, ==, !=, %in%`

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13)
x < 10
```

```{r}
x %in% 1:10
```

We can use logical vectors to select data from a data frame.

```{r}
index <- dat$Group == 'Control'
dat[index,]$BloodPressure
```

Often this operation is written as one line of code:

```{r}
plot(dat[dat$Group == 'Control',]$BloodPressure)
```

### Using Logical Indexes

  + 1. Create a scatterplot showing BloodPressure for subjects not in the control group.
  + 2. How many ways are there to index this set of subjects?

## Combining Indexing and Assignment

The assignment operator `<-` can be combined with indexing.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13)
x[x < 10] <- 0
x
```

### Updating a Subset of Values

In this dataset, values for Gender have been recorded as both uppercase `M, F` and lowercase `m,f`. Combine the indexing and assignment operations to convert all values to lowercase.

## Key Points

  + 1. Data in data frames can be addressed by index (slicing), by logical vector, or by name (columns only).
  + 2. Use the $ operator to address a column by name.
